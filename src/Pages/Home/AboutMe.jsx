          <h5 className="hero--section-description">
            I'm currently a junior at Stanford University, studying management science and engineering. 
            I was raised by immigrant parents from Central America and Mexico, making me a proud first-generation student. 
            My love for the kitchen grew from watching tons of shows on Food Network and helping around in the kitchen 
            during the holidays. From writing down recipes, to helping making tamales for the holiday season, I learned 
            the power of spreading love, joy, and health through food.

          <h5 className="hero--section-description">
            I aspire to share this passion with others by creating a platform where I can showcase these cherished recipes
            and cooking techniques, blending traditional flavors with innovative ideas. My goal is to inspire others to 
            find joy and wellness in cooking, just as I have, and to celebrate the rich culinary heritage of my family.
